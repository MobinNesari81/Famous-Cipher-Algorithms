Code Manual
-----------
To complete this project, you will have to make modifications in **DenseConnection** and **RandomConnection** in \
`cnsproject.network.connections module`. Make sure to read the documentation provided in **AbstractConnection** \
beforehand. You can also define more modules inheriting **AbstractConnection** and defining different patterns \
of connectivity, if desired. You may ignore *update* method as it will be required in case of learning.

Furthermore, you might need to modify *forward* method of your neural populations to be able to handle input from \
other populations. In other words, you will need to consider how to convert pre-synaptic spikes into current or make \
changes to support spike as input to *forward*.

A simple network is constructed from the components you are already familiar with, i.e. neural populations, \
the connections among them, and monitor objects. So, instead of writing a long script everytime to run a simulation, \
you can implement *run* method of **Network** in `cnsproject.network.network module`. Read the documentation provided \
in **Network** class and see how it can reduce the amount of code you will have to write everytime. You will need \
to complete this method in future to include other computations as well.

Do not forget to implement the required visualization functions/classes. Use monitor to record the desired variables.
