# Phase 2
1. Implement Exponential Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuronal model with modifiable
   parameters.
    - visit `cns2021/network/neural_population.py` file.
    - Read documentation for `NeraulPopulation` base class.
    - Fill in the body of `ELIFPopulation`.
2. Inject constant current into the system and plot the F-I curve and voltage changes through time.
3. Report the results with visualizations for different parameter sets (at least 5).
4. Inject a current values of which changes randomly through time into the system
   and plot the voltage changes through time.
5. Repeat step 3.
