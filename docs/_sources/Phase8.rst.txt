Code Manual
-----------
In this project, you will need to implement Difference of Gaussian and Gabor filters. You can define them anywhere \
and anyhow you wish. Yet, it is recommended to implement them in the form of classes with an abstract base class \
**Filter**. You can either create a new package (e.g. *image_processing* or *filters*) or implement them in the \
`utils.py` file or somewhere in `cnsproject.encoding package`.

You will have to use your previously written encoders. You may also want to add some visualization functions.
