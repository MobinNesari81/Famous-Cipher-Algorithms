Code Manual
-----------
You will have to fill in the **ConvolutionalConnection** and **PoolingConnection** classes in `cnsproject.network.conne\
ction module`. In **PoolingConnection**, it said to consider an attribute for specifying type of pooling (i.e. max pool \
or average pool). You may ignore that and only implement the max pooling functionality. You will also add an attribute \
in **ConvolutionalConnection** to specify the filter and use the functions/classes from previous phase. You might \
need to reconsider *update* of your learning rules.
