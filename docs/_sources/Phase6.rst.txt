Code Manual
-----------
You will need to complete the body of **STDP** and **FlatSTDP** classes in `cnsproject.learning.learning_rules module`. \
Read the documentation provided in **LearningRule** before getting started.

To move further in the project, you will have to make a dense connection between an instance of **InputPopulation** \
and an instance of one of the neural populations you have implemented in phases 1 and 2. The **InputPopulation** will \
take care of input spikes and you will not need to modify unless you wish it to have a different behavior. You can \
also add other modules and functions if you like. You will also need to modify *run* method of **Network** accordingly. \
Also do not forget to complete *update* and *compute* in **Connection classes** in case you left them intact or \
incomplete in previous projects.
