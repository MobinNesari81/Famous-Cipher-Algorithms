Code Manual
-----------
For this phase, you will need to complete **ELIFPopulation** and **AELIFPopulation** in \
`cnsproject.network.neural\_populations module`. You can ignore the following attributes in this phase:

* spike_trace
* additive_spike_trace
* tau_s
* trace_scale
* is_inhibitory
* learning

The first four parameters are responsible for spike traces. You can simply call *forward* and *compute_decay* of the \
parent class at the end of the corresponding method in **ELIFPopulation** and **AELIFPopulation**. You can change \
their parent to **LIFPopulation** as well but more care might be needed for spike trace computation (Since the parent \
contains more computation procedures than just a single spike trace update).

Make sure to read the documentation provided in **NeuralPopulation** class before getting started.
You will also need an object of **Monitor** to record parameters of the neuron through time. The class is located in \
`cnsproject.network.monitors module`. Read the documentation and instruction provided in its file for further details.
Implement all your visualization functions and classes in `plotting module`.
