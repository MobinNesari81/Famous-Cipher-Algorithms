Code Manual
-----------
Complete **WinnerTakeAllDecision** class in `cnsproject.decision.decision module`. You should also implement lateral \
inhibition mechanism. It is suggested to place it in `utils.py` but you can implement it in any other file you like. \
You will need to use **InputPopulation** for first layer to feed the filtered image into the network. You may also \
need to modify network to handle the decision object and computations.

In case you have not implemented any visualization utility for plotting the convolutional weights, you will need to \
do so in this phase represent the extracted features.
