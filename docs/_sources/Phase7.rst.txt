Code Manual
-----------
You will need to complete the body of **RSTDP** and **FlatRSTDP** classes in `cnsproject.learning.learning_rules \
module`. Read the documentation provided in **LearningRule** before getting started. To define the dopamine function \
(DA), you will need to write a reward class inheriting **AbstractReward** defined in `cnsproject.learning.rewards \
module`. Make sure to read its documentation beforehand.

As in the previous project, you will have to make a dense connection between an instance of **InputPopulation** \
and an instance of one of the neural populations you have implemented in phases 1 and 2. The **InputPopulation** will \
take care of input spikes and you will not need to modify unless you wish it to have a different behavior. You can \
also add other modules and functions if you like. You will also need to modify *run* method of **Network** accordingly.
