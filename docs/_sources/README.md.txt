# cns-project-template
This repository provides the template interface for computational neuroscience
course project, Department of Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science,
University of Tehran.

## Usage
Use your GitHub accounts to fork the project template and get started with it.
It is recommended to make one if you do not have any, however, you can still
clone the source and work locally. To clone the project, use:

**Note:** You should add your additional plotting libraries to the environment.

## About Project
The goal of this project is to implement the basics of a spiking neural network
and deepen your knowledge on them. By completing this project, you will have a
simple framework for implementing spiking neural networks.

The project is divided into multiple phases. In each phase, you will complete
some part of this template. Follow the phases in order and complete the tasks.
The packages and/or modules to be modified are mentioned in each phase's
directives. Make sure to read the documentation of the module(s) before getting
